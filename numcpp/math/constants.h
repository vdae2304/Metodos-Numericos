 * NumCPP is a package for scientific computing in C++. It is a C++ library
 * that provides support for multidimensional arrays, and defines an assortment
 * of routines for fast operations on them, including mathematical, logical,
 * sorting, selecting, I/O and much more.
 *
 * NumCPP comes from Numeric C++ and, as the name suggests, is a package
 * inspired by the NumPy package for Python, although it is completely
 * independent from its Python counterpart.
